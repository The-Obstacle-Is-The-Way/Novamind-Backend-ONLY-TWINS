# Novamind Digital Twin - Neural Architecture Script System

This directory contains all the neural pathways for orchestrating the Digital Twin platform's development, testing, deployment, and maintenance operations. The scripts are organized with mathematical precision following clean architecture principles.

## Neural Directory Structure

### `/scripts/core/`

Fundamental neural components that drive the core orchestration processes:

- `docker_test_runner.py` - Quantum-level test orchestration system with mathematically precise execution paths
- `docker_entrypoint.py` - Neural entrypoint for container initialization with enhanced brain region connectivity

### `/scripts/deploy/`

Deployment operations with scientifically accurate system modeling:

- `deploy_and_test.sh` - Clean architecture deployment system with precise neurotransmitter pathway verification

### `/scripts/fixers/`

Self-healing system components that maintain neural pathway integrity:

- `fix_utc_imports.py` - UTC import transformer that ensures proper datetime handling across the codebase

### `/scripts/utils/`

Utility modules for neural architecture enhancement:

- `datetime_transformer.py` - Mathematically precise datetime utilities for neurotransmitter temporal modeling

### `/scripts/test/`

Legacy test runners and migration scripts (maintained for backward reference only):

- Multiple test organization and execution components (consider these deprecated in favor of core components)

## Brain Region Support

These scripts support proper modeling of all brain regions including the PITUITARY, which was added to enhance hypothalamus-pituitary connectivity in the neurotransmitter system. The enhanced architecture properly propagates neurotransmitter effects with precise magnitude calculations.

## Neurotransmitter Processing

The scripts in the neural architecture support the temporal neurotransmitter mapping system with proper effect magnitudes ('large' or 'medium') and accurate cascade modeling between brain regions.

## Mathematical Precision

All components are designed with quantum-level mathematical precision to ensure:

- Deterministic test outcomes
- Reproducible deployments
- Scientifically accurate neural pathway mapping
- Statistical significance in all clinical data modeling

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run complete test suite with quantum-level precision
./scripts/deploy/deploy_and_test.sh

# Run specific test levels directly
python -m scripts.core.docker_test_runner [standalone|unit|integration|api|e2e|all]
```

### Fixing UTC Imports

```bash
# Fix UTC imports across the codebase
python -m scripts.fixers.fix_utc_imports
```
