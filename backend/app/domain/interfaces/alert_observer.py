"""
Alert Observer Interface for the Digital Twin Psychiatry Platform.

This module defines the AlertObserver interface, which implements the Observer
pattern for the biometric alert system. Observers are notified when new alerts
are generated, allowing for flexible handling of alerts by different components.
