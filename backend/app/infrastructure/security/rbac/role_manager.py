HIPAA-Compliant Role-Based Access Control System

This module implements a comprehensive RBAC system for enforcing
access controls as required by HIPAA Security Rule ยง 164.308(a)(4),
which mandates implementation of information access management policies.

Features:
- Granular permission system with role hierarchies
- Permission checking based on user roles
- Support for patient-specific access controls
- Audit trail capabilities for access decisions

Usage:
    # Create RBAC system and register roles
    rbac = RoleBasedAccessControl()
    rbac.register_role("doctor", ["read:patients", "write:notes"])

    # Check permissions
    has_permission = rbac.check_permission("doctor", "read:patients")

    # Verify user has required permission
    is_authorized = verify_permission(user, "write:prescriptions")
