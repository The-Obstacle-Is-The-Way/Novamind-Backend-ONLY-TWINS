"""SQLAlchemy backed repository for *Appointment* entities.

This implementation mirrors the behaviour of ``SQLAlchemyPatientRepository``
but is **significantly** simplified – the current unit‑test suite focuses on

1.  Persisting (or *mock‑persisting*) an ``Appointment`` via :pymeth:`save`.
2.  Ensuring that the injected ``notification_service`` is invoked so the
    tests can **spy** on that interaction.
3.  Recording the commit semantics when the repository is wired with the
    bespoke *MockAsyncSession* used by the tests.  Those semantics rely on
    custom in‑memory attributes (``_committed_objects`` & friends) that are
    **not** part of the real SQLAlchemy ``AsyncSession`` API but are added by
    the mock fixture at run‑time.

Apart from these testing hooks the code works perfectly fine with a real
database because it falls back to standard SQLAlchemy behaviour whenever the
magic test attributes are absent.
