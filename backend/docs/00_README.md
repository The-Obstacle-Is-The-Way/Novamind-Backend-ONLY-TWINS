# Novamind Digital Twin: Architectural Documentation

This directory contains foundational architectural documentation for the Novamind Digital Twin platform, covering core aspects of the system design.

## Core Architecture Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [AUTHENTICATION.md](./AUTHENTICATION.md) | Authentication and authorization architecture with HIPAA compliance considerations |
| [DOMAIN_MODELS.md](./DOMAIN_MODELS.md) | Core domain models and entities for the Digital Twin system |
| [STORAGE.md](./STORAGE.md) | Persistent storage architecture with HIPAA-compliant data handling |
| [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) | Deployment infrastructure and container orchestration |

## Architecture Overview

The Novamind Digital Twin platform follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic and domain models
2. **Application Layer**: Implements use cases and orchestrates domain objects
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides technical capabilities like persistence and external services
4. **API Layer**: Exposes the system's functionality through REST endpoints

## Key Architectural Principles

- **Strict Domain Isolation**: Domain models have no dependencies on infrastructure
- **Dependency Inversion**: All dependencies point inward toward the domain
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies are injected, not imported directly
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access through abstract repository interfaces
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation where applicable
- **HIPAA Compliance by Design**: Security and privacy built into the architecture
