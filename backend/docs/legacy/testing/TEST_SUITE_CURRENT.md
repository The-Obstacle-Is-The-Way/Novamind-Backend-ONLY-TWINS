# Current Test Suite Status

## 1. Test Directory Structure Overview

The Novamind Digital Twin Platform currently has tests split across **two separate directory structures**:

### A. `/backend/app/tests/`

This directory contains tests embedded within the app package, organized hierarchically to match the application structure:

```
backend/app/tests/
├── application/
│   └── services/
│       └── test_temporal_neurotransmitter_service.py
├── core/
│   └── services/
│       └── ml/
│           ├── test_mock.py                      # Basic ML mock tests
│           ├── test_mock_dt.py                   # Digital Twin mock tests
│           └── test_mock_phi.py                  # PHI detection mock tests
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   │   ├── test_neurotransmitter_mapping.py
│   │   └── test_temporal_neurotransmitter.py
│   └── services/
│       └── test_enhanced_xgboost_service.py
├── enhanced/
│   ├── test_enhanced_digital_twin_integration.py
│   └── test_neurotransmitter_mapping_integration.py
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── logging/
│   │   └── test_logger.py
│   ├── repositories/
│   │   ├── test_temporal_event_repository.py
│   │   └── test_temporal_sequence_repository.py
│   └── services/
│       └── test_mock_enhanced_digital_twin_neurotransmitter_service.py
└── integration/
    ├── test_digital_twin_integration.py
    └── test_temporal_neurotransmitter_integration.py
```

**Key Observations**:
- All ML mock tests that were run successfully in the terminal exist in this structure
- Missing a dedicated `/security/` folder as referenced in the test scripts
- Contains enhanced integration tests

### B. `/backend/tests/`

This is a separate, more comprehensive test directory outside the app package:

```
backend/tests/
├── api/
│   ├── integration/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── unit/
├── core/
│   └── services/
│       └── ml/
│           └── xgboost/
├── e2e/                       # End-to-end tests
│   └── test_patient_flow.py
├── integration/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── infrastructure/
│   ├── persistence/
│   └── security/
├── security/                  # Dedicated security test suite
│   ├── test_api_hipaa_compliance.py
│   ├── test_api_security.py
│   ├── test_audit_logging.py
│   ├── test_auth_hipaa_compliance.py
│   ├── test_auth_middleware.py
│   ├── test_database_security.py
│   ├── test_db_phi_protection.py
│   ├── test_encryption.py
│   ├── test_hipaa_compliance.py
│   ├── test_jwt_auth.py
│   ├── test_jwt_service.py
│   ... (many more security tests)
└── unit/
    ├── api/
    ├── application/
    ├── core/
    ├── domain/
    ├── infrastructure/
    └── presentation/
```

**Key Observations**:
- Contains a dedicated `/security/` folder with extensive security tests
- Has a well-organized structure aligning with test types (unit, integration, e2e)
- Some security tests test components that don't exist in the expected locations

## 2. Test Configuration Issues

### Test Runner Script

The `run_tests.py` script is configured to search for tests in specific locations:

- **ML Mock tests**: Looking in `/app/tests/core/services/ml/`
- **Security tests**: Looking in `/app/tests/security/` (which doesn't exist)
- **Unit tests**: Looking in `/app/tests/unit/` or `/app/tests/domain/` and `/app/tests/core/`
- **Integration tests**: Looking in `/app/tests/integration/`

### Test Execution

The test runner works via the `run-tests.sh` bash script, which delegates to `scripts/run_tests.py` with different flags. These flags include:

- `--unit`: Run unit tests
- `--integration`: Run integration tests 
- `--ml-mock`: Run ML mock tests (currently working correctly)
- `--security`: Run security tests (currently failing due to missing directory)

### Pytest Configuration

The `pytest.ini` and `pyproject.toml` files contain configuration that might be referencing specific test paths and markers.

## 3. Current Test Isolation Issues

1. **Directory Structure Conflict**: The existence of two separate test directories violates the principle of having a single source of truth.

2. **Import Path Confusion**: Tests in `/backend/tests/` may have different import paths than those in `/backend/app/tests/`.

3. **Fixture Sharing Issues**: Fixtures defined in one test directory may not be accessible from the other.

4. **Configuration Fragmentation**: Test configuration (pytest.ini, conftest.py) might be duplicated or inconsistent.

## 4. Security Testing Gap

The primary security tests exist in `/backend/tests/security/` but the test runner is looking for them in `/app/tests/security/`, creating a critical gap in test coverage.

## 5. Current Coverage Status

- **ML Mock Tests**: PASSING (as seen in the terminal output)
- **Security Tests**: FAILING (directory mismatch)
- **Overall Coverage**: Approximately 9% (far below the required 80%)
- **Component-Specific Coverage**:
  - Core domain models: Well below the required 90%
  - Security components: Well below the required 95%
  - PHI handling: Well below the required 100%

## 6. Dependency Issues

Some tests may be referencing modules that don't exist in the expected locations, such as:
- `app.core.audit` (exists as `app.infrastructure.security.audit`)
- `app.api.auth` (missing or in a different location)

## 7. Conclusion

The current test suite structure is fragmented and inconsistent, preventing proper execution of critical tests, especially security tests. This has led to dangerously low test coverage and potential compliance gaps for this HIPAA-regulated application.
