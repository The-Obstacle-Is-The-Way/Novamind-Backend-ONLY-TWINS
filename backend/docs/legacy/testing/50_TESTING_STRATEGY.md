## Overview

The Novamind Digital Twin Platform requires a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure that it meets the highest standards of quality, security, and compliance. This strategy defines a multi-layered approach to testing that covers all aspects of the platform, from individual units to system-wide integration and security.

The primary goals of this testing strategy are to:

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify that all components work as specified
2. **Validate Security**: Confirm that security controls are effective
3. **Verify Performance**: Ensure the system meets performance requirements
4. **Maintain Compliance**: Validate HIPAA compliance across the platform
5. **Support Reliability**: Confirm system stability and fault tolerance
6. **Enable Agility**: Allow rapid development without compromising quality

This strategy applies to all components of the Novamind Digital Twin Platform, including backend services, AI/ML components, APIs, and supporting infrastructure.

## Testing Principles

Our testing approach is guided by the following core principles:

1. **Test Early, Test Often**
   - Testing should begin at the earliest stages of development
   - Continuous testing integrated into the development workflow
   - Issues detected and fixed as early as possible

2. **Test Automation First**
   - Automate tests whenever possible
   - Manual testing reserved for exploratory testing and user experience validation
   - Automated regression testing for all critical functionality

3. **Test Independence**
   - Tests should be independent of each other
   - Tests should not depend on external systems when possible
   - Test isolation to prevent cross-test interference

4. **Test Relevance**
   - Focus testing effort on critical and high-risk areas
   - Balance test coverage with development velocity
   - Prioritize tests based on business impact and technical risk

5. **Test Data Privacy**
   - Never use real PHI in testing environments
   - Synthetic or de-identified data for all testing
   - Data generation that mimics production patterns without exposing PHI

6. **Test Maintenance**
   - Tests must be maintained alongside code changes
   - Flaky tests addressed promptly
   - Regular review and cleanup of test suites

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the correctness of individual components in isolation.

**Scope**:
- Individual functions, methods, and classes
- Domain model behavior
- Business logic implementation
- Utility functions

**Characteristics**:
- Fast execution (milliseconds)
- No external dependencies (databases, APIs, etc.)
- High coverage (>90% for core domain logic)
- Mock or stub external dependencies

**Implementation**:

```python
# Example of a domain model unit test
import pytest
from datetime import date
from uuid import uuid4
from app.domain.models.patient import Patient, Gender

def test_patient_age_calculation():
    # Arrange
    patient_id = uuid4()
    birth_date = date(1980, 6, 15)
    patient = Patient(
        id=patient_id,
        first_name="John",
        last_name="Doe",
        birth_date=birth_date,
        gender=Gender.MALE
    )
    
    # Act
    age = patient.calculate_age(reference_date=date(2023, 6, 15))
    
    # Assert
    assert age == 43
```

**Best Practices**:
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- One assertion per test when possible
- Parameterize tests for multiple similar cases

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work correctly together.

**Scope**:
- Service layer interactions
- Repository implementations with databases
- API controllers with service layer
- External service integrations

**Characteristics**:
- Medium execution speed (seconds)
- Test against real or in-memory databases
- Test real HTTP calls to API endpoints
- Focus on component interactions

**Implementation**:

```python
# Example of a repository integration test
import pytest
from uuid import uuid4
from app.domain.models.patient import Patient, Gender
from app.infrastructure.repositories.patient_repository import SQLAlchemyPatientRepository
from app.infrastructure.db.session import get_test_db

@pytest.fixture
def db_session():
    # Setup in-memory test database
    session = get_test_db()
    yield session
    # Teardown - roll back transaction
    session.rollback()

def test_patient_repository_save_and_get(db_session):
    # Arrange
    repository = SQLAlchemyPatientRepository(db_session)
    patient_id = uuid4()
    patient = Patient(
        id=patient_id,
        first_name="Jane",
        last_name="Smith",
        birth_date=date(1985, 3, 20),
        gender=Gender.FEMALE
    )
    
    # Act
    repository.save(patient)
    retrieved_patient = repository.get_by_id(patient_id)
    
    # Assert
    assert retrieved_patient is not None
    assert retrieved_patient.id == patient_id
    assert retrieved_patient.first_name == "Jane"
    assert retrieved_patient.last_name == "Smith"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use test fixtures for common setup
- Clean up test data after tests
- Test transactional behavior
- Validate both success and error paths

### System Tests

System tests verify the behavior of the entire system as a whole.

**Scope**:
- End-to-end workflows
- System-wide behavior
- Cross-component interactions
- External system interfaces

**Characteristics**:
- Slower execution (seconds to minutes)
- Test against a complete system environment
- Validate full business processes
- Tests from user perspective

**Implementation**:

```python
# Example of a system test for patient registration flow
import pytest
import requests
from app.tests.utils.test_client import get_test_client
from app.tests.utils.auth import get_test_token

def test_patient_registration_flow():
    # Arrange
    client = get_test_client()
    token = get_test_token(role="clinician")
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    
    patient_data = {
        "firstName": "Robert",
        "lastName": "Johnson",
        "dateOfBirth": "1975-08-10",
        "gender": "male",
        "contactInformation": {
            "email": "robert.j@example.com",
            "phone": "555-123-4567"
        }
    }
    
    # Act - Register patient
    register_response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/patients",
        json=patient_data,
        headers=headers
    )
    
    # Assert registration
    assert register_response.status_code == 201
    patient_id = register_response.json()["id"]
    
    # Act - Retrieve patient
    get_response = client.get(
        f"/api/v1/patients/{patient_id}",
        headers=headers
    )
    
    # Assert retrieval
    assert get_response.status_code == 200
    retrieved_patient = get_response.json()
    assert retrieved_patient["firstName"] == "Robert"
    assert retrieved_patient["lastName"] == "Johnson"
    
    # Act - Update patient
    update_response = client.patch(
        f"/api/v1/patients/{patient_id}",
        json={"contactInformation": {"email": "r.johnson@example.com"}},
        headers=headers
    )
    
    # Assert update
    assert update_response.status_code == 200
    assert update_response.json()["contactInformation"]["email"] == "r.johnson@example.com"
```

**Best Practices**:

from app.tests.utils.auth import generate_test_token

class ApiUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)
    
    def on_start(self):
        self.token = generate_test_token(role="clinician")
        self.headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}"}
    
    @task(3)
    def get_patients(self):
        self.client.get("/api/v1/patients", headers=self.headers)
    
    @task(1)
    def get_patient_details(self):
        patient_ids = ["550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", 
                       "7df78614-0c14-4d6b-8b91-3e0a5e179cd2"]
        for patient_id in patient_ids:
            self.client.get(f"/api/v1/patients/{patient_id}", headers=self.headers)
    
    @task(2)
    def search_patients(self):
        self.client.get("/api/v1/patients?name=Smith", headers=self.headers)
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Response time (median, 95th percentile, max)
