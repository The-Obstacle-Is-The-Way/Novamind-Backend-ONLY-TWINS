## Overview

The Novamind Digital Twin Platform is designed to process, store, and transmit Protected Health Information (PHI) and must therefore adhere to the regulations outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This document outlines the specific requirements and implementation approaches to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations across all aspects of the platform.

Key compliance principles include:

1. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls built into the architecture
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access necessary for functionality
4. **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are verified
5. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI interactions

These principles are implemented through a combination of technical safeguards, administrative procedures, and physical controls to create a comprehensive compliance framework.
