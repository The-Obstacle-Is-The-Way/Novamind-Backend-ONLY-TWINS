# Novamind Digital Twin Platform: Refactoring Documentation

## Introduction

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for refactoring the Novamind Digital Twin Platform to achieve production readiness while eliminating legacy EHR dependencies. The documentation provides a detailed analysis of the current architecture, a specification of the target architecture, and a step-by-step implementation plan.

   - Refactoring priorities based on architectural assessment

2. **[Target Architecture](01_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
   - Detailed specification of the target architecture
   - Architectural principles and guidelines
   - Core domain models, repository interfaces, and service designs
   - Concrete design examples for key components

3. **[Implementation Plan](02_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**
   - Week-by-week implementation roadmap
   - Specific tasks, dependencies, and success criteria
   - Risk management strategy and contingency plans
   - Metrics and monitoring approach

4. **[Implementation Examples](03_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md)**
   - Concrete code examples for key components
   - Best practices for implementing the new architecture
   - Testing examples for each architectural layer
   - Implementation sequence recommendations

5. **[Executive Summary](04_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)**
   - High-level overview of the refactoring strategy
   - Key architectural decisions and their rationale
   - Success metrics and expected outcomes
   - Resource requirements and timeline summary

## Key Architectural Vision

The core architectural vision centers on:

1. **DigitalTwinSubject Abstraction**: A clean, forward-focused identity abstraction that completely replaces patient/EHR dependencies while maintaining necessary clinical context.

2. **Clean Repository Pattern**: Consistently applied repository interfaces for all data access, with PostgreSQL implementations and comprehensive testing support.

3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models that capture the psychiatric digital twin concepts with precision and clarity.

4. **Service Layer Separation**: Well-defined application services with clear responsibilities and dependencies.

5. **HIPAA-Compliant API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with consistent patterns, comprehensive validation, and proper security controls.

## Implementation Timeline

The refactoring is structured into six one-week sprints:

- **Week 1**: Identity Refactoring
- **Week 2**: Repository Layer Implementation
- **Week 3**: Application Services Refactoring
- **Week 4**: API & Integration Layer
- **Week 5**: Testing & Security
- **Week 6**: Production Readiness

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the refactoring plan:

1. Review the [Current State Analysis](00_CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md) to understand the existing architecture
2. Study the [Target Architecture](01_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md) to grasp the architectural vision
3. Follow the [Implementation Plan](02_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for a week-by-week roadmap
4. Use the [Implementation Examples](03_IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md) as templates for your implementation

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. All code references `DigitalTwinSubject` consistently with no patient/EHR dependencies
2. Test coverage exceeds 90% across all components
3. All security audits pass without critical or high findings
4. Deployment pipeline successfully builds and deploys the application
5. Performance benchmarks meet or exceed baseline metrics
