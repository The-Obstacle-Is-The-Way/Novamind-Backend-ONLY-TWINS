## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Hidden patient dependencies discovered | High | Medium | Incrementally test each component; maintain regression test suite |
| Database migration issues | High | Low | Create comprehensive test fixtures; maintain rollback scripts |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Conduct performance testing at each stage; optimize critical paths |
| Missing test coverage | Medium | Medium | Track coverage metrics; prioritize critical path testing |
| Integration issues with ML services | Medium | Medium | Create stable abstraction interfaces; mock dependencies in testing |

## Rollback Strategy

For each PR and deployment, maintain the following rollback capabilities:

1. **Database Migration**: All schema changes have corresponding down migrations
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to gradually enable new functionality
3. **Dual Running**: Maintain ability to route to old or new implementation during transition
4. **Backup Strategy**: Create database snapshots before major migrations
5. **Version Control**: Maintain clean git history with atomic commits

## Metrics and Monitoring

Track the following metrics during implementation:

1. **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% across all components
2. **Code Quality**: Monitor complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index)
3. **API Performance**: Track response times for key endpoints
4. **Error Rates**: Monitor application errors and exceptions
5. **Security Posture**: Track security findings and remediation status

## Tooling

The following tools will support the implementation:

1. **Testing**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio
2. **Static Analysis**: pylint, mypy, bandit
3. **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, safety
4. **Database Migrations**: Alembic
5. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
6. **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana

## Special Considerations

### Backward Compatibility

While the goal is to eliminate legacy dependencies, consider these transitional strategies:

1. **Abstraction Layers**: Use temporary abstraction layers where needed
2. **Conversion Functions**: Create bidirectional mapping between old and new models
3. **Dual Implementation**: Maintain both implementations briefly where critical

### ML Integration

The ML integration components require special attention:

1. **XGBoost Wrapper**: Create clean interface for XGBoost predictions
2. **MentalLLaMA Integration**: Update prompt templates and response parsing
3. **PAT Integration**: Ensure actigraphy transformation preserves data integrity

## Team Collaboration

Effective team collaboration is critical for successful implementation:

1. **Daily Standup**: Brief update on progress and blockers
2. **PR Reviews**: All changes require peer review before merging
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation alongside code changes
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Regularly share architectural insights and decisions

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to refactoring the Novamind Digital Twin Platform to achieve the target architecture. By following this week-by-week plan, the team can systematically eliminate legacy dependencies while maintaining system integrity and enhancing the core psychiatric digital twin functionality.

Progress should be tracked against the success criteria for each sprint, with adjustments made as needed based on discoveries during implementation. With disciplined execution of this plan, the platform will achieve production readiness within the six-week timeframe.
