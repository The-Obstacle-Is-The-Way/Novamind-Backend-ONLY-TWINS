## 2. Test Categories

### Unit Tests (Target: 90% Coverage)

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation. In the Novamind architecture, these should follow these principles:

- **Domain Layer Tests**: 100% coverage of domain entities, value objects, and services
- **Application Layer Tests**: 90% coverage of use cases and application services
- **Core Tests**: 90% coverage of core utilities and services
- **Infrastructure Tests**: 90% coverage of infrastructure components

### Integration Tests (Target: 80% Coverage) 

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly:

- **API Integration**: Test API endpoints with mock services
- **Persistence Integration**: Test repositories with test databases
- **Security Integration**: Test security components working together
- **ML Service Integration**: Test ML service interaction with other components

### Security Tests (Target: 95% Coverage)

Security tests specifically verify HIPAA compliance and security mechanisms:

- **Authentication Tests**: Verify authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization Tests**: Verify role-based access controls
- **Encryption Tests**: Verify data is properly encrypted
- **Audit Logging Tests**: Verify all PHI access is logged
- **PHI Protection Tests**: Verify PHI is properly protected
- **JWT Tests**: Verify token security

### Enhanced Tests (Target: 85% Coverage)

Enhanced tests provide more rigorous coverage for critical components:

- **Digital Twin Enhanced Tests**: Deeper testing of digital twin components
- **PHI Detection Enhanced Tests**: More rigorous PHI detection scenarios
- **Security Enhanced Tests**: Additional security edge cases

## 3. Test Execution Strategy

### Test Running Script Functionality

The test runner should:

1. **Auto-discover tests** based on directory structure and naming patterns
2. **Support explicit test selection** by test category or path
3. **Generate coverage reports** for different test categories
4. **Execute tests in isolation** to prevent contamination
5. **Respect test dependencies** and run in the correct order

### Test Configuration

The unified test configuration should include:

- **Single pytest.ini file** with all settings
- **Shared conftest.py** for common fixtures
- **Environment-specific configurations** for different test environments
- **Coverage configuration** with appropriate thresholds

## 4. HIPAA Compliance Testing Specifics

For HIPAA compliance, the test suite must specifically include:

1. **PHI Access Audit Testing**: Verify every access to PHI is logged
2. **Authorization Boundary Testing**: Verify authorization boundaries cannot be bypassed
3. **Data Encryption Testing**: Verify PHI is encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **Error Handling Testing**: Verify errors don't expose PHI
5. **Session Timeout Testing**: Verify inactive sessions are terminated

## 5. Test Quality Standards

All tests should adhere to these standards:

1. **Clear Naming**: Test names should clearly indicate what they test
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: Follow this pattern for clear test structure
3. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on other tests
4. **Performance**: Tests should be efficient and not slow down the suite
5. **Documentation**: Tests should include docstrings explaining their purpose

## 6. Test Environment Management

For consistent test execution, the environment should be:

1. **Isolated**: Tests should run in an isolated environment
2. **Reproducible**: Test results should be reproducible
3. **Clean**: Environment should be cleaned between test runs
4. **Controlled**: External dependencies should be mocked or controlled

## 7. Continuous Integration Integration

The test suite should integrate with CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Automatic Execution**: Tests should run automatically on push/PR
2. **Failure Visibility**: Test failures should be clearly reported
3. **Coverage Tracking**: Coverage should be tracked over time
4. **Security Gating**: Security tests should gate releases

## 8. Conclusion

This ideal test architecture ensures comprehensive coverage, maintains HIPAA compliance, and facilitates efficient test execution. By organizing tests according to this structure and following these principles, the Novamind Digital Twin Platform can achieve robust test coverage and maintain the highest standards of security and reliability.
