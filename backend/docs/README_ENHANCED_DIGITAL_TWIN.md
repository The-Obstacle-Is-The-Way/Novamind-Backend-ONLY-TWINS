# Novamind Enhanced Digital Twin

## Introduction

The Novamind Enhanced Digital Twin represents a significant advancement in psychiatric care technology. Building upon the foundation of the original Digital Twin, this enhanced version incorporates sophisticated AI components and advanced knowledge representation systems to provide unprecedented capabilities for personalized psychiatric care.

## Architecture Overview

The Enhanced Digital Twin integrates three state-of-the-art AI components (the "Trinity Stack"):

1. **MentalLLaMA-33B**: Advanced language model for clinical text understanding and reasoning
2. **XGBoost Prediction Engine**: Sophisticated prediction and optimization engine
3. **Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT)**: Deep analysis of physiological and behavioral data

These components feed into a central orchestration service that maintains:
- Temporal Knowledge Graph: Representing entities and relationships over time
- Bayesian Belief Network: Enabling probabilistic reasoning with uncertainty quantification

The architecture follows Clean Architecture principles with strict separation of concerns:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic (entities, repositories, service interfaces)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implementation of services, data access, external integrations
- **Application Layer**: Use cases orchestrating the services
- **Presentation Layer**: API endpoints and UI components (to be implemented)
