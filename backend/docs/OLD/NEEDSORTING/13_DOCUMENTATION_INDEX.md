## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Clean Architecture

NOVAMIND follows Clean Architecture principles, with the following layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities and rules, with no dependencies on external frameworks
- **Data Layer**: Implements repositories and data access, depending only on the domain layer
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases, depending on domain and data layers
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interaction, depending on application layer

### Digital Twin

The Digital Twin is a core feature of NOVAMIND that provides a virtual representation of a patient's mental health:

- **Symptom Forecasting**: Predicts future symptom trajectories
- **Biometric-Mental Correlation**: Correlates biometric data with mental health indicators
- **Precision Medication Modeling**: Predicts medication responses based on patient data

### ML Microservices

NOVAMIND uses a microservices architecture for machine learning components:

- **Symptom Forecasting Microservice**: Predicts future symptom trajectories
- **Biometric-Mental Health Correlation Microservice**: Analyzes correlations between biometric data and mental health
- **Pharmacogenomics Microservice**: Predicts medication responses based on genetic markers
- **Digital Twin Integration Service**: Coordinates all microservices

### HIPAA Compliance

NOVAMIND is designed to be HIPAA compliant, with the following key components:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Role-based access control and secure authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption of PHI at rest and in transit
- **Secure Communication**: TLS for all API communication
