### Key Design Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Convert domain entities to ML model inputs and vice versa
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Allow interchangeable ML algorithms behind consistent interfaces
3. **Factory Pattern**: Create complex ML model instances with proper configuration
4. **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access for model training and inference

## Model Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Model Interfaces

All ML models must implement a consistent interface:

```python
class ModelInterface:
    """Base interface for all ML models in the system."""
    
    def predict(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Make a prediction using the model.
        
        Args:
            input_data: Dictionary containing model inputs
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing model outputs
            
        Raises:
            ModelInferenceError: If prediction fails
        """
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def get_metadata(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Get model metadata including version, training date, etc.
        
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing model metadata
        """
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### 2. Model Implementation Structure

Each model should be structured as follows:

```
ml/
├── model_type/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── model.py           # Core model implementation
│   ├── preprocessor.py    # Input data preprocessing
│   ├── postprocessor.py   # Output data postprocessing
│   ├── config.py          # Model configuration
│   └── utils.py           # Helper functions
```

### 3. Error Handling

- Use specific exception types (e.g., `ModelInferenceError`) for different failure modes
- Include detailed error messages that aid debugging without exposing PHI
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical model components
