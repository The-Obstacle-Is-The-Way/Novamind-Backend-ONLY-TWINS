# Biometric Alert System Design

## Overview

This document provides detailed design specifications for the biometric alert system in the Novamind concierge psychiatry platform, based on the digital twin research from Frontiers in Psychiatry (2023). The alert system is a critical component that translates biometric data into clinically actionable insights while maintaining HIPAA compliance and clinical validity.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Biometric Event Processor**
   - Central service that processes incoming biometric data
   - Implements the Observer pattern for alert notification
   - Evaluates data against clinical rules
   - Generates alerts based on rule conditions

2. **Clinical Rule Engine**
   - Manages the definition and evaluation of clinical rules
   - Supports template-based and custom rule creation
   - Provides rule versioning and audit capabilities
   - Implements clinical validation of rule conditions

3. **Alert Repository**
   - Stores and retrieves alert records
   - Implements HIPAA-compliant data access patterns
   - Provides filtering and querying capabilities
   - Manages alert lifecycle (creation to resolution)

4. **Rule Repository**
   - Stores and retrieves rule definitions
   - Manages rule activation status
   - Supports patient-specific and global rules
   - Implements rule versioning and history

### Data Flow

```
Biometric Data → Event Processor → Rule Evaluation → Alert Generation → Clinical Notification
```

## Domain Model

### Alert Rule

The `AlertRule` entity represents a clinical rule that can trigger alerts based on biometric data:

```
AlertRule
├── rule_id: Unique identifier
├── name: Descriptive name
├── description: Detailed explanation
├── priority: Clinical urgency level (urgent, warning, informational)
├── condition: Logic that triggers the alert
├── created_by: Clinician who created the rule
├── patient_id: Optional patient this rule applies to (null for global rules)
├── created_at: Creation timestamp
├── updated_at: Last update timestamp
└── is_active: Whether the rule is currently active
```

#### Rule Conditions

Rule conditions should be represented as structured objects that can be evaluated against biometric data:

```json
{
  "data_type": "heart_rate",
  "operator": ">",
  "threshold": 100.0,
  "duration": {
    "value": 10,
    "unit": "minutes"
  },
  "context": {
    "activity": "resting"
  }
}
```

#### Rule Templates

The system should provide pre-defined rule templates for common clinical scenarios:

1. **Physiological Anomalies**
   - High/low heart rate
   - Irregular heart rhythm
   - Abnormal blood pressure
   - Sleep disruption patterns

2. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Reduced physical activity
   - Social isolation indicators
   - Disrupted daily routines
   - Medication adherence issues

3. **Symptom Escalation**
   - Increasing anxiety metrics
   - Mood deterioration patterns
   - Stress level elevation
   - Cognitive function changes

### Biometric Alert

The `BiometricAlert` entity represents a specific instance of a rule being triggered:

```
BiometricAlert
├── alert_id: Unique identifier
├── patient_id: Patient this alert is for
├── rule_id: Rule that triggered this alert
├── rule_name: Name of the rule (denormalized for historical accuracy)
├── priority: Urgency level (from rule)
├── message: Human-readable alert description
├── data_point: Biometric data that triggered the alert
├── context: Additional contextual information
├── created_at: When the alert was generated
├── acknowledged: Whether a clinician has acknowledged the alert
├── acknowledged_at: When the alert was acknowledged
└── acknowledged_by: Who acknowledged the alert
```

## Clinical Considerations

### Alert Prioritization

Based on the research paper's findings on clinical urgency, alerts should be categorized into three priority levels:

1. **Urgent (Red)**
   - Requires immediate clinical attention
   - Indicates potential serious clinical deterioration
   - Examples: Severe heart rate anomalies, critical medication non-adherence

2. **Warning (Yellow)**
   - Requires attention within 24 hours
   - Indicates concerning patterns that may lead to deterioration
   - Examples: Sleep pattern disruption, moderate mood decline

3. **Informational (Blue)**
   - Routine clinical information
   - Provides context for patient monitoring
   - Examples: Minor deviations from baseline, positive improvement trends

### Clinical Validation

The paper emphasizes the importance of clinical validation for alert rules:

1. **Evidence-based thresholds**: Alert thresholds should be based on clinical literature when available
2. **Sensitivity calibration**: Rules should be calibrated to minimize false positives
3. **Context awareness**: Rules should consider patient context (e.g., activity level, time of day)
4. **Individual baselines**: Thresholds should adapt to individual patient baselines over time

## HIPAA Compliance Requirements

### Data Minimization

The alert system must implement data minimization principles:

1. **PHI exclusion**: Alert messages should not contain unnecessary PHI
2. **Metadata filtering**: Only clinically relevant metadata should be included
3. **Access controls**: Alerts should only be visible to authorized clinicians
4. **Audit logging**: All alert access and acknowledgment should be logged

### Secure Communication

Alert notifications must be transmitted securely:

1. **Encrypted channels**: All alert notifications must use encrypted communication
2. **Authentication**: Recipients must be authenticated before receiving alerts
3. **Device validation**: Notifications should only be sent to approved devices
4. **Content protection**: Alert content in notifications should be minimized

## Implementation Patterns

### Observer Pattern

The biometric event processor should implement the Observer pattern to notify clinical staff of alerts:

```
Subject (BiometricEventProcessor)
├── register_observer(observer)
├── unregister_observer(observer)
└── notify_observers(alert)

Observer (AlertNotifier)
└── update(alert)

ConcreteObservers
├── EmailNotifier
├── SMSNotifier
├── DashboardNotifier
└── EHRIntegrationNotifier
```

### Strategy Pattern

The rule evaluation should use the Strategy pattern to support different types of clinical rules:

```
RuleEvaluationStrategy
└── evaluate(data_point, rule)

ConcreteStrategies
├── ThresholdRuleStrategy
├── TrendRuleStrategy
├── PatternRuleStrategy
└── CompositeRuleStrategy
```

### Factory Pattern

Rule creation should use the Factory pattern to standardize rule creation:

```
RuleFactory
├── create_rule_from_template(template_id, parameters)
└── create_custom_rule(rule_data)
```

## API Design

### Rule Management Endpoints

```
GET    /biometric-alerts/rules                 # List all rules
POST   /biometric-alerts/rules                 # Create a new rule
GET    /biometric-alerts/rules/{rule_id}       # Get a specific rule
PUT    /biometric-alerts/rules/{rule_id}       # Update a rule
DELETE /biometric-alerts/rules/{rule_id}       # Delete a rule
GET    /biometric-alerts/rule-templates        # List available rule templates
```

### Alert Management Endpoints

```
GET    /biometric-alerts/alerts                # List all alerts
GET    /biometric-alerts/alerts/{alert_id}     # Get a specific alert
POST   /biometric-alerts/alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge  # Acknowledge an alert
GET    /biometric-alerts/patients/{patient_id}/alerts   # Get patient alerts
```

## Testing Strategy

   - Consider distributed processing for large patient populations

2. **Alert Storage Optimization**
   - Implement efficient indexing for alert queries
   - Consider time-based partitioning for alert storage
   - Implement archiving strategy for historical alerts

### Latency Requirements

Based on clinical urgency levels:

1. **Urgent Alerts**: < 1 minute from data receipt to notification
2. **Warning Alerts**: < 5 minutes from data receipt to notification
3. **Informational Alerts**: < 15 minutes from data receipt to notification

## Future Enhancements
