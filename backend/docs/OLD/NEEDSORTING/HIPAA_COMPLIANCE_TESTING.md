# NOVAMIND HIPAA Compliance Testing Framework

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for maintaining HIPAA compliance in the NOVAMIND platform through security testing and validation. Our multi-layered security testing approach ensures that all requirements for handling Protected Health Information (PHI) are met at every level of the application.

## HIPAA Security Requirements

The HIPAA Security Rule comprises three types of safeguards:

1. **Administrative Safeguards**: Policies and procedures to protect ePHI
2. **Physical Safeguards**: Controls for physical access to PHI
3. **Technical Safeguards**: Technology and policies to protect ePHI

Our testing framework focuses primarily on the **Technical Safeguards**, which include:

- **Access Control**: Ensuring only authorized users can access PHI
- **Audit Controls**: Hardware, software, and procedures to record and examine access
- **Integrity Controls**: Measures to ensure PHI is not improperly altered or destroyed
- **Transmission Security**: Protections for PHI when transmitted electronically

## Testing Components

Our HIPAA testing framework includes the following components:

### 1. Unit Tests for Security Components

These tests verify that individual security components function correctly. Each component test validates a specific aspect of our security infrastructure:

- **Password Handler Tests**: Ensure proper hashing, validation, and strength requirements
- **JWT Handler Tests**: Verify token issuance, validation, and expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control Tests**: Confirm permissions enforcement for clinical roles
- **Encryption Tests**: Validate field-level encryption for PHI at rest

### 2. Security Integration Tests

These tests verify that security components work together correctly as an integrated system:

- **Authentication Flow**: Tests complete authentication process
- **Authorization Boundaries**: Validates access control across role boundaries
- **Token Security**: Ensures proper token handling in the authentication flow

### 3. HIPAA Compliance Tests

These tests specifically target HIPAA requirements:

- **PHI Protection**: Verifies PHI redaction in logs and responses
- **Access Controls**: Tests role-based access to sensitive patient data
- **Audit Trail**: Ensures proper logging of all PHI access attempts
- **Encryption**: Verifies data protection at rest and in transit

### 4. Security Vulnerability Scanner

Scans the codebase for potential security issues:

- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Detects passwords, keys, or credentials in code
- **PHI in Logs**: Identifies potential PHI leakage in logging statements
- **SQL Injection**: Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Weak Encryption**: Identifies usage of weak cryptographic algorithms
- **HIPAA Specific Checks**: Validates HTTPS enforcement, secure cookies, etc.

### 5. Dependency Security Scan

Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies:

- **CVE Scanning**: Detects known vulnerabilities in Python packages
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Identifies dependencies that need updates
- **License Compliance**: Ensures all dependencies have appropriate licenses

## Running the Tests

We've provided several scripts to simplify running the security tests:

### Basic Security Test Command

```bash
# Run from project root (with executable permissions)
./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh
```

This executes all security tests and generates a comprehensive report.

### Additional Options

```bash
# Generate HTML report
./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --html-report

# Skip the vulnerability scanning (faster)
./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --skip-scan

# Show detailed output
./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --verbose

# Combine options
./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --html-report --verbose
```

## Setting Up the Testing Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-security.txt
   ```

2. **Make Scripts Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh
   chmod +x scripts/security_scanner.py
   chmod +x scripts/run_security_tests.py
   ```

3. **Run in CI/CD Pipeline**:

   Add this to your CI/CD configuration:
   ```yaml
   hipaa_testing:
     stage: test
     script:
       - pip install -r requirements-security.txt
       - ./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --html-report
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - reports/security/
   ```

## Understanding Test Results

### HTML Reports

When using the `--html-report` flag, detailed reports are generated in the `reports/security/` directory:

- **full_security_report.html**: Complete report of all security tests
- **unit_tests_report.html**: Report for security component unit tests
- **integration_tests_report.html**: Report for security integration tests
- **hipaa_tests_report.html**: Report specific to HIPAA compliance tests

### Console Output

The console output provides a summary of all test results, including:

- Pass/fail status for each test category
- Details of any vulnerabilities or issues found
- Summary of HIPAA compliance status

## HIPAA Compliance Checklist

To maintain HIPAA compliance, ensure the following requirements are met:

- [ ] All authentication flows validate user identity with MFA
- [ ] All PHI is encrypted at rest using strong encryption (AES-256)
- [ ] All PHI in transit is protected via TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)
- [ ] Access controls enforce role-based permissions
- [ ] Audit logs track all access to PHI without logging the PHI itself
- [ ] Session timeout enforced (max 15 minutes for high-risk operations)
- [ ] No PHI in logs, URL parameters, or error messages
- [ ] All vulnerabilities from dependency scans are addressed
- [ ] Security tests run in CI/CD pipeline before deployment

## Maintaining Compliance Over Time

### Regular Testing

Run the full HIPAA compliance test suite:
- Before all production deployments
- After significant security changes
- On a monthly schedule as part of regular maintenance

### Dependency Updates

- Run `./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --skip-scan` after updating dependencies
- Address any new vulnerabilities immediately

### Code Reviews

Use the security scanner during code reviews:
```bash
python scripts/security_scanner.py --verbose
```

### Audit Trail

Maintain a record of all compliance testing:
```bash
# Example: Save dated reports
./scripts/hipaa_compliance_check.sh --html-report
cp reports/security/full_security_report.html reports/security/audit/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_report.html
```

## HIPAA Documentation Requirements

For HIPAA compliance, maintain the following documentation:

1. **Security Risk Assessment**: Update annually and after major changes
2. **Security Incident Response Plan**: Document procedures for potential breaches
3. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Required for all vendors with PHI access
4. **Security Test Results**: Keep the past 12 months of security test reports
5. **HIPAA Training Records**: Document staff training on PHI handling

## Conclusion

This testing framework provides a comprehensive approach to validating HIPAA compliance in the NOVAMIND platform. By regularly running these tests and addressing any issues found, we ensure that our platform maintains the highest standards of security and privacy for sensitive patient information.
