# HIPAA Test Coverage Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the test coverage requirements for maintaining HIPAA compliance in the Novamind Backend system. Test coverage is a critical aspect of HIPAA Security Rule compliance, ensuring that all code handling Protected Health Information (PHI) operates correctly and securely.

## üìä Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Threshold

- **HIPAA Requirement: 80% minimum test coverage across the codebase**
- Critical modules (security, PHI handling, authentication) should aim for **95%+ coverage**
- No individual module should fall below **50% coverage**

### Priority Order for Testing

1. **Security & PHI Handling (Highest Priority)**
   - `app/infrastructure/security/`
   - Encryption utilities
   - PHI sanitization modules
   - Logging systems that might encounter PHI

2. **Core Utilities**
   - `app/core/utils/`
   - Data transformation utilities
   - Configuration handlers

3. **Domain Layer**
   - `app/domain/entities/`
   - `app/domain/services/`
   - Patient-related models and logic

4. **Application Services**
   - `app/application/services/`
   - Business logic orchestration

5. **API & Presentation Layer**
   - Endpoints and controllers
   - Request/response handlers

## üß™ Running Test Coverage Analysis

### Command Line

```bash
# Run from project root
python scripts/check_test_coverage.py

# Alternative: Run pytest directly with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html:coverage-reports/html
```

### Interpreting Results

- **Overall Coverage**: Shown as a percentage at the top of the report
- **Coverage by Module**: Detailed breakdown by file/module
- **Missing Lines**: Lines that have no test coverage
- **Complexity**: Indicates code that may need more thorough testing

## üìù Test Writing Guidelines for HIPAA Compliance

### PHI Handling Tests

When testing code that processes PHI:

1. **Never use real PHI** in tests, even if anonymized
2. Use clearly fabricated test data:
   ```python
   # Good examples of fabricated PHI for tests
   test_ssn = "123-45-6789"
   test_name = "John Doe"
   test_dob = "1900-01-01"
   ```

3. Verify that PHI sanitization works:
   ```python
   def test_log_sanitization():
       """Test that PHI is properly redacted from logs."""
       log_message = "Patient John Doe (SSN: 123-45-6789) accessed their records"
       sanitized = log_sanitizer.sanitize(log_message)
       assert "John Doe" not in sanitized
       assert "123-45-6789" not in sanitized
       assert "[REDACTED]" in sanitized
   ```

### Security Testing

1. **Authentication Tests**: Verify token validation, role-based access, and session handling
2. **Authorization Tests**: Ensure endpoints enforce appropriate permissions
3. **Encryption Tests**: Validate that data is properly encrypted/decrypted
4. **Error Handling**: Test that PHI is never exposed in error responses

### Integration Testing for PHI Flows

Create end-to-end tests that follow PHI through the system:

1. From API reception
2. Through processing/storage
3. To sanitized logging
4. To secure client response

## üîç Addressing Low Coverage

When modules fall below the 50% threshold:

1. **Identify Critical Paths**: Focus on code that handles PHI first
2. **Write Missing Tests**: Follow the test naming convention:
   ```
   app/infrastructure/security/log_sanitizer.py
   ‚Üí tests/unit/infrastructure/security/test_log_sanitizer.py
   ```
3. **Run Incremental Coverage**: Check coverage after adding each batch of tests

## ü§ñ CI/CD Integration

The HIPAA compliance pipeline automatically:

1. Runs all tests with coverage analysis
2. Fails builds that fall below 80% coverage
3. Generates coverage reports for review
4. Alerts the team to modules falling below thresholds

## üïí Regular Audit Process

1. **Weekly Coverage Check**: Run `python scripts/check_test_coverage.py` weekly
2. **Monthly Full Audit**: Run complete test suite and review coverage reports
3. **Quarterly Security Review**: Focus on security and PHI handling modules
4. **Pre-Release Verification**: Ensure 80%+ coverage before any deployment

## üßπ Test Maintenance

1. **Clean up old tests** that test deprecated functionality
2. **Update mock data** to ensure it remains fabricated
3. **Refactor complex tests** to improve maintainability
4. **Document test approach** in code comments
5. **Review test code** for potential security issues
