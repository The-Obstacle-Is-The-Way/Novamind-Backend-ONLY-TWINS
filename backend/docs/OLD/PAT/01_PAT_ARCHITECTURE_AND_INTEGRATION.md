# Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT) Architecture and Integration

## Overview

The Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT) serves as the biometric component of our digital twin psychiatry platform, replacing the previously planned LSTM implementation. PAT is an open-source transformer model specifically designed for wearable actigraphy time-series data, developed by researchers at Dartmouth College's Jacobson Lab.

This document outlines the core architecture of PAT and how it integrates with our existing digital twin platform following Clean Architecture principles.

## Core Architecture

### What is PAT?

PAT is a transformer-based model pretrained on large actigraphy datasets (primarily NHANES, ~29k participants) to create a foundation model for wearable movement data. It processes raw accelerometer data from wearable devices to extract meaningful patterns related to physical activity, sleep, and other biometric indicators that correlate with mental health states.

Key features:
- Transformer architecture optimized for time-series actigraphy data
- Pretrained on large datasets to establish robust feature extraction
- Available in three sizes: PAT-S (small), PAT-M (medium), and PAT-L (large)
- Capable of fine-tuning for specific mental health outcomes
- Requires GPU acceleration for optimal performance

### Integration with Digital Twin Architecture

The PAT module will be implemented as a dedicated microservice within our clean architecture:

1. **Domain Layer**: 
   - Define domain entities for actigraphy data and analysis results
   - Establish value objects for biometric patterns and mental health correlations
   - Define repository interfaces for actigraphy data access

2. **Data Layer**:
   - Implement repository patterns for actigraphy data storage and retrieval
   - Create data transformations between raw device data and PAT-compatible formats
   - Establish persistence mechanisms for analysis results

3. **Application Layer**:
   - Define use cases for actigraphy analysis (e.g., sleep quality assessment, activity pattern recognition)
   - Implement services to orchestrate the analysis workflow
   - Create interfaces for integration with other digital twin components

4. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Implement the PAT model loader and inference service
   - Create adapters for various wearable data sources
   - Establish GPU-accelerated containerized deployment

5. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Define FastAPI endpoints for actigraphy data submission and analysis retrieval
   - Implement Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
   - Create secure API documentation

## Integration with Existing Digital Twin Components

The PAT module will integrate with other components of our digital twin platform:

1. **MentalLLaMA Integration**:
   - PAT will provide biometric insights to complement MentalLLaMA's NLP-based analysis
   - Correlation between physical activity patterns and linguistic markers
   - Combined insights for more comprehensive mental health assessment

2. **Pharmacogenomics Module**:
   - Activity pattern changes can indicate medication effectiveness or side effects
   - PAT insights can inform medication adjustments based on biometric responses

3. **Symptom Forecasting**:
   - PAT-derived activity patterns serve as input features for symptom prediction models
   - Temporal changes in activity can precede symptom manifestation

4. **Digital Twin Aggregation**:
   - PAT results will be incorporated into the unified digital twin representation
   - Weighted integration of biometric data with other modalities

## Data Flow

1. Wearable devices collect raw accelerometer data
2. Data is securely transmitted to the platform via encrypted channels
3. Raw data is preprocessed and formatted for PAT input
4. PAT model processes the data and extracts relevant features
5. Analysis results are stored in HIPAA-compliant databases
6. Results are integrated with other digital twin components
7. Insights are made available to clinicians through secure APIs

## Technical Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x (2.18.0 recommended) with GPU support
- NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN libraries
- FastAPI for API implementation
- Containerization with Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- AWS deployment with GPU-enabled instances
- HIPAA-compliant data storage and transmission
