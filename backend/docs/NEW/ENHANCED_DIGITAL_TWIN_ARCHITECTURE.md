# Enhanced Digital Twin Architecture

## Architectural Overview

The Enhanced Digital Twin architecture represents the next generation of the Novamind Digital Twin platform, integrating three sophisticated AI components (Trinity Stack) with an advanced knowledge representation system. This document outlines the architectural decisions, component interactions, and data flow mechanisms that enable this state-of-the-art psychiatric care platform.

## Advanced Knowledge Representation

The Enhanced Digital Twin employs two sophisticated knowledge representation structures:

### 1. Temporal Knowledge Graph

- **Purpose**: Represent clinical entities, relationships, and their evolution over time
- **Structure**:
  - `KnowledgeGraphNode`: Represents clinical entities (symptoms, diagnoses, medications, brain regions, etc.)
  - `KnowledgeGraphEdge`: Represents relationships between entities (causes, correlates, alleviates, etc.)
  - `TemporalKnowledgeGraph`: Container for nodes and edges with temporal capabilities
- **Key Operations**:
  - Pattern extraction (causal chains, temporal sequences, symptom clusters)
  - Temporal subgraph extraction
  - Neighborhood exploration
  - Cascade analysis

### 2. Bayesian Belief Network

- **Purpose**: Enable probabilistic reasoning about clinical state with uncertainty quantification
- **Structure**:
  - Variables (mood, sleep, activity, etc.)
  - Conditional probabilities
  - Dependency relationships
- **Key Operations**:
  - Evidence incorporation
  - Belief state updates
  - Variable conditioning
  - Probability propagation

## Service Layer Design

The Enhanced Digital Twin employs a layered service architecture:

### 1. Domain Services (Interfaces)

- **EnhancedMentalLLaMAService**: Interface for LLM capabilities
- **EnhancedXGBoostService**: Interface for prediction capabilities
- **EnhancedPATService**: Interface for biometric analysis capabilities
- **EnhancedDigitalTwinCoreService**: Orchestration interface

### 2. Infrastructure Services (Implementations)

- **MockEnhancedMentalLLaMAService**: Mock implementation
- **MockEnhancedXGBoostService**: Mock implementation
- **MockEnhancedPATService**: Mock implementation
- **MockEnhancedDigitalTwinCoreService**: Mock implementation with event system

### 3. Factory Pattern

- **EnhancedMockDigitalTwinFactory**: Creates and wires service instances with proper dependency injection

## Event System

The Enhanced Digital Twin uses an event-driven architecture for communication:

- **Event Types**: Categorized by source and action (e.g., `digital_twin.initialized`, `knowledge_graph.updated`)
- **Event Subscriptions**: Components can subscribe to specific event types
- **Event Publishing**: Components can publish events to the system
- **Event History**: Patient-specific event histories are maintained for auditing

## Data Flow

The Enhanced Digital Twin processes data through the following flow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Multimodal patient data is received (text, physiological, behavioral, genetic)
2. **AI Processing**: The Trinity Stack components process their respective data types
3. **Insight Generation**: Clinical insights are extracted from AI processing results
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Insights are integrated into the knowledge graph and belief network
5. **State Update**: The Digital Twin state is updated with new insights
6. **Event Publication**: Events are published to notify subscribers of changes
7. **Analysis & Visualization**: Advanced analyses are performed and visualization data is generated

## HIPAA Compliance & Security

Security and privacy considerations are embedded throughout the architecture:

1. **Data Isolation**: Patient data is strictly isolated by patient ID
2. **Minimal PHI**: Only necessary patient identifiers are used
3. **Event Logging**: All operations are logged for audit purposes
4. **Access Control**: Service interfaces enforce appropriate access controls
5. **Clean Separation**: Domain layer contains no infrastructure dependencies that might leak PHI

## Performance Optimization

The Enhanced Digital Twin employs several performance optimizations:

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: All service methods are asynchronous to enable concurrent operation
2. **Parallel AI Execution**: Trinity Stack components can process data in parallel
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Components subscribe to events rather than polling for changes
4. **Selective Processing**: Only relevant data is passed to each AI component
5. **Caching Strategy**: Results are cached where appropriate to avoid redundant computation
