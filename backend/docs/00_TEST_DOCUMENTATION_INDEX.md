- CI/CD pipeline updates
- Implementation timeline and success criteria

**Primary Use**: Executing the migration to the new test infrastructure.

### [04_SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDELINES.md](04_SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDELINES.md)

This document focuses specifically on security testing requirements for the Novamind platform:

- Security testing principles
- Security test categories and examples
- Security test organization
- Coverage requirements for security code

- Best practices for security testing

**Primary Use**: Ensuring comprehensive security testing and HIPAA compliance.

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Team Members

1. Start with **02_TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_SSOT.md** to understand the test organization
2. Review **04_SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDELINES.md** to understand security testing requirements
3. Reference the other documents as needed

### For Developers Writing Tests

1. Refer to **02_TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_SSOT.md** for test structure and conventions
2. Follow the security guidelines in **04_SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDELINES.md**
3. Use the test directory structure to determine where to place new tests

### For DevOps and CI/CD Engineers

1. Review **03_TEST_SUITE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** for test execution infrastructure
2. Implement the CI/CD pipeline updates as specified

### For Project Managers and Architects

1. Review **01_TEST_SUITE_ANALYSIS.md** to understand the state of the test suite
2. Reference **02_TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_SSOT.md** for the target architecture
3. Use **03_TEST_SUITE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** for planning and resource allocation

## Test Organization Principles

The core principle of our test organization is the dependency-based directory structure:

```
backend/app/tests/
├── standalone/  # No external dependencies
├── venv/        # Python package dependencies only
├── integration/ # External service dependencies
├── conftest.py  # Shared fixtures
└── helpers/     # Test utilities
```

This structure:

1. **Optimizes for speed** - Faster tests run first
2. **Clarifies dependencies** - Tests are organized by what they need to run
3. **Simplifies CI/CD** - Progressive test execution
4. **Improves maintainability** - Clear, consistent organization

## Test Coverage Requirements

Overall test coverage requirements:

| Component           | Coverage Target |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Domain layer        | 90%            |
| Application layer   | 85%            |
| Infrastructure layer| 75%            |
| Security code       | 100%           |
| Overall coverage    | 80%            |

## Conclusion

This documentation set provides a comprehensive foundation for the Novamind Digital Twin test infrastructure. By following these guidelines, we ensure a consistent, maintainable, and effective testing approach that supports our commitment to quality, security, and HIPAA compliance.

For any questions or clarifications regarding testing, refer first to these documents, particularly the **02_TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_SSOT.md**, which serves as the definitive reference for all testing matters.
