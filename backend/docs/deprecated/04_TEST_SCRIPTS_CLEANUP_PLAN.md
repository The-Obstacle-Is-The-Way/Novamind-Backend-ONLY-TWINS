# Novamind Digital Twin Test Scripts Cleanup Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and action plan for cleaning up and reorganizing the test scripts in the Novamind Digital Twin project. The goal is to establish a clean, consistent, and maintainable set of test scripts that align with the dependency-based testing approach documented in the Test Infrastructure SSOT.

## Current State of Test Scripts

The `/backend/scripts/` directory currently contains various ad-hoc test scripts, runners, and utilities that have evolved organically over time. This has led to:

1. **Duplication of functionality**: Multiple scripts performing similar operations
2. **Inconsistent naming conventions**: No standardized naming pattern
3. **Mixed responsibilities**: Scripts handling multiple concerns
4. **Documentation gaps**: Limited inline documentation
5. **Execution inconsistencies**: Different entry points for similar operations

## Target State

The reorganized `/backend/scripts/test/` directory will follow this structure:

```
/backend/scripts/test/
├── runners/               # Test execution scripts
│   ├── run_tests.py       # Main unified test runner
│   ├── run_security.py    # Security-focused test runner
│   └── run_performance.py # Performance test runner
├── migrations/            # Test migration tools
│   ├── migrate_tests.py   # Test migration script
│   └── test_analyzer.py   # Test analyzer utility
├── tools/                 # Test utilities
│   ├── coverage_report.py # Coverage reporting tool
│   ├── test_formatter.py  # Test formatting utility
│   └── test_linter.py     # Test linting utility
└── ci/                    # CI integration scripts
    ├── ci_test_runner.py  # CI-specific test runner
    └── test_badge.py      # Test badge generator
```

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Inventory

1. **Inventory all existing test scripts**
   - Document location, purpose, and dependencies
   - Identify scripts that can be consolidated
   - Flag deprecated or unused scripts

2. **Functional analysis**
   - Map script functionality to target structure
   - Identify gaps in current tooling
   - Document requirements for new scripts

### Phase 2: Restructuring

1. **Create directory structure**
   - Establish the target directory hierarchy
   - Set up proper package structure with `__init__.py` files

2. **Move and consolidate scripts**
   - Relocate scripts to their appropriate directories
   - Merge scripts with overlapping functionality
   - Update imports and dependencies

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. **Develop the canonical test runner**
   - Implement `/backend/scripts/test/runners/run_tests.py`
   - Support all dependency levels and test markers
   - Include reporting and coverage analysis

2. **Implement migration tools**
   - Complete `/backend/scripts/test/migrations/migrate_tests.py`
   - Add test analyzer for dependency detection
   - Support clean rollback capabilities

3. **Create utility scripts**
   - Implement common test utilities
   - Add test formatting and linting tools
   - Create consistent coverage reporting

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation

1. **Remove deprecated scripts**
   - Archive or delete unused scripts
   - Ensure clean migration paths for all functionality

2. **Document script usage**
   - Add detailed docstrings and comments
   - Create examples of common usage patterns
   - Update README files with script documentation

3. **Update CI/CD configuration**
   - Update CI/CD pipelines to use new scripts
   - Configure appropriate test levels for each pipeline stage

## Implementation Priorities

To move quickly toward production readiness, focus on these high-priority items:

1. **Canonical test runner** - Essential for consistent test execution
2. **Test migration script** - Required to organize tests by dependency
3. **CI integration** - Needed for automated testing in the deployment pipeline

## Execution Timeline

| Task | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Inventory existing scripts | 1 day | None |
| Create directory structure | 0.5 day | Inventory |
| Implement canonical test runner | 2 days | Directory structure |
| Implement migration tools | 3 days | Directory structure |
| Update CI configuration | 1 day | Canonical test runner |
| Cleanup deprecated scripts | 1 day | All implementations |
| Documentation | 1 day | All implementations |

## Success Criteria

The script reorganization will be considered successful when:

1. All tests can be run through the canonical test runner
2. Tests are properly organized by dependency level
3. CI/CD pipelines use the new script structure
4. All scripts include proper documentation
5. No deprecated or duplicate scripts remain

## Conclusion

This cleanup plan provides a clear roadmap for organizing and standardizing the test scripts in the Novamind Digital Twin project. By following this plan, we'll establish a production-ready test infrastructure that supports the dependency-based testing approach and ensures consistent, reliable test execution across all environments.
