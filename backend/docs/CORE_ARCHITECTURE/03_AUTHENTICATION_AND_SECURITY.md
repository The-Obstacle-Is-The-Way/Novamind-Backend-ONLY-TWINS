## Overview

The Novamind Digital Twin Platform implements a comprehensive security architecture designed to protect sensitive patient data while enabling appropriate access for authorized clinical users. Security is implemented as a cross-cutting concern that permeates all aspects of the system architecture.

Key security principles include:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access rights
3. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verification for all access attempts
4. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy controls built into core architecture
5. **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing security validation and testing

These principles are implemented through a combination of:
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Granular authorization controls
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Active threat monitoring and prevention

## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system verifies user identity and establishes secure sessions for all platform interactions.

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow follows these steps:

1. **Identity Verification**
   - Username/password validation against secure identity store
   - Multi-factor authentication when required by policy
   - SSO integration with enterprise identity providers (optional)

2. **Session Establishment**
   - JWT token issuance with appropriate claims
   - Session context creation
   - Client state synchronization

3. **Session Maintenance**
   - Sliding expiration for active sessions
   - Absolute timeout enforcement
   - Heartbeat verification for session validity

4. **Session Termination**
   - Explicit logout capabilities
   - Automatic timeout after inactivity
   - Forced termination for security events
