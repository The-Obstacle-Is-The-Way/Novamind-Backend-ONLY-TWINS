## Overview

The Digital Twin is a comprehensive computational model that creates a dynamic, temporally-aware representation of a patient's psychiatric state. It integrates data from multiple sources, including clinical documentation, biometric measurements, treatment records, and predictive models to create a cohesive, evolving representation of psychiatric health.

The Digital Twin serves as the core state model for the Novamind Platform, enabling:
- Temporal tracking of psychiatric state evolution
- Multi-modal data integration
- Predictive modeling of treatment responses
- Personalized intervention planning
- Research-grade data collection and analysis

## Core Concepts

### Digital Twin Definition

A Digital Twin in the context of psychiatry is defined as:

> A temporally-aware computational representation of a patient's psychiatric state that integrates multi-modal data streams, maintains temporal consistency, and provides both retrospective analysis and prospective prediction capabilities.

Key attributes of the psychiatric Digital Twin include:

1. **Temporal Dynamics**: Represents state evolution over time
2. **Multi-Scale Modeling**: Integrates data from molecular to behavioral scales
3. **Bidirectional Updating**: Updates based on new data and influences data collection
4. **Explainability**: Provides interpretable insights into psychiatric state
5. **Predictive Capability**: Forecasts potential state changes and treatment responses

### Conceptual Framework

The Digital Twin is built on a conceptual framework that includes:

- **State Representation**: The current and historical psychiatric state
- **Temporal Dynamics**: How the state evolves over time
- **Causal Relationships**: The factors that influence state changes
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: The confidence levels in the represented state
- **Intervention Modeling**: The impact of treatments on state trajectories
