## Overview

The Trinity Stack is the foundational architecture that powers the Novamind Digital Twin Platform. It represents a paradigm shift in psychiatric analytics by combining three specialized AI/ML systems that work in concert to create a comprehensive psychiatric digital twin.

The three core components of the Trinity Stack are:

1. **MentalLLaMA**: Advanced natural language processing for clinical text understanding
2. **PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer)**: Activity and biometric pattern analysis
3. **XGBoost**: Predictive modeling and risk stratification engine

These components integrate with the Digital Twin core to provide a multi-modal, temporally-aware representation of psychiatric state.

## Architecture Principles

The Trinity Stack adheres to the following architectural principles:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Each component operates within a well-defined clinical domain
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between components with defined interfaces
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Components interact through a standardized event mesh
4. **Temporal Awareness**: All data and state changes are temporally anchored
5. **HIPAA Compliance by Design**: Security and privacy controls at every layer

The architecture follows clean architecture principles with:

- Domain layer (pure business logic)
- Application layer (use cases and state management)
- Infrastructure layer (external services and persistence)
- API layer (communication interfaces)

## Data Flow

The Trinity Stack processes data through the following flow:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Clinical notes and EHR data → MentalLLaMA
   - Activity and biometric data → PAT
   - Structured clinical data → XGBoost

2. **Processing and Analysis**:
   - MentalLLaMA extracts clinical insights from unstructured text
   - PAT identifies behavioral and physiological patterns
   - XGBoost generates predictions and risk assessments

3. **Integration**:
   - All outputs are temporally aligned
   - Conflicting signals are reconciled through confidence-weighted fusion
   - Results are integrated into the Digital Twin state

4. **Feedback Loops**:
   - Clinical outcomes feed back into model training
   - System performance metrics guide component optimization
   - User feedback improves recommendation relevance
