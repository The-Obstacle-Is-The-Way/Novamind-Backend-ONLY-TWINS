# XGBoost Integration with Digital Twin

## Digital Twin Concept in Psychiatric Care

The Digital Twin concept in the Novamind platform represents a comprehensive virtual model of a patient's mental health status, history, and predicted trajectories. XGBoost models serve as the predictive engine for this Digital Twin, enabling dynamic, personalized psychiatric care.

### Core Components of the Psychiatric Digital Twin

1. **Historical Representation**: Structured timeline of patient's mental health journey
2. **Current State Model**: Multi-dimensional representation of current psychiatric status
3. **Predictive Projections**: XGBoost-powered forecasts of potential trajectories
4. **Intervention Simulations**: Modeled responses to potential treatments
5. **Contextual Factors**: Environmental and social determinants affecting outcomes

## XGBoost Role in Digital Twin Architecture

### Predictive Component Integration

XGBoost models are integrated into the Digital Twin architecture as specialized predictive components:

1. **Model Registry Integration**
   - Models are registered with the Digital Twin system
   - Version control ensures reproducibility
   - Model metadata links predictions to training data
   - Capability advertising enables appropriate model selection

2. **Prediction Flow**
   - Digital Twin requests predictions based on clinical context
   - Feature Service assembles required features
   - XGBoost Service generates predictions
   - Results are incorporated into Digital Twin profile
   - Confidence metrics are attached to all predictions

3. **Update Mechanism**
   - New data triggers incremental profile updates
   - Significant changes prompt full profile recalculation
   - Temporal consistency is maintained across updates
   - Historical predictions are preserved for comparison
